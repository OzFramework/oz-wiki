When writing code for Oz we follow these rules:
- Two spaces, no tabs (for indentation).
- No trailing whitespace. Blank lines should not have any spaces.
- Prefer `and`/`or` over `&&`/`||`.
- Use `my_method(my_arg)` not `my_method( my_arg )` or `my_method my_arg`.
- Use `a = b` and not `a=b`.
- Prefer `method { do_stuff }` instead of `method{do_stuff}` for single-line blocks.
- Put spaces after list items and method parameters (`[1, 2, 3]`, not `[1,2,3]`).
- NEVER use single letter variables (even in loops).
- Code is generally written once, but read many times over. Consider the people who will read your code, and make it look nice for them.
- Follow the conventions in the source you see used already.
